# arrjit

arrjit is short for "arrangement jit". It's a max4live patch that syncs videoplayback in the arrangement view of a track into jit. This allows you to treat arrangement view of a track like a timeline video editor by stacking jit video processing on top of this patch.

NOTE: this project is still very much a work in progress.
